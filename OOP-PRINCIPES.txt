OOP PRINCIPES
	*- ENCAPSULATION
		Definition (protecting and preventing data altering by outside by create private fields)
		 
			EXEMPLE:
				CAT with 
				
				PRIVATE FIELDS (hungry, energy, meow()) and 
				PUBLIC METHODS 
					sleep() - energy +, hungry +
					feed () - hungry -, energy +, meow()
		Action Objects do not change fields directly, but call methods than change them indirectly.
		Benefits  	-Protection of data from accidental corruption.
					-Specification of the accessibility of each of the members of a class to the code outside the class
		
	*- ABSTRACTION
		Definition (hiding internal/certain details and showing only functionality/essentil information)
		 
			EXEMPLE:
				COFFEE MACHINE - WE DO NOT NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT PREPARE COFFEE 
				INSTEAD WE KNOW TO PUSH BUTTON THAT MAKES IT WORK 
			
		Action -Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects 
				(to access it, it must be inherited from another class);
			   -Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, 
			   and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).
		Benefits - allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override
				 - reusable code, simpler, easier to change
	*- INHERITANCE
		Definition (CHILD / SUBCLASS / DERIVED CLASS 
					INHERITS FUNCTIONALITY OF PARENT / SUPERCLASS / BASE CLASS
					AS FIELDS AND METHODS)
					* FOR SIMILAR OBJECTS WITH COMMON LOGIG. BUT NOT THE SAME
		Action 	To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.
				
		Benefits - code reusability, readablity
				 -  extensibility by overriding the base class functionality within child classes
				 - modify the behavior defined in other classes
	*- Polymorphism "MANY FORMS"
		Definition (ABILITY CHILD CLASSES / INSTANCE OF OBJECT 
					TO HAVE DIFF FORMS AND BEHAVIORS LIKE DIFF implementations of methods)
		EXEMPLE:
				BASE CLASS ANIMAL (PRODUCED SOUND, VIRTUAL METHOD)
				CHILD DOG (SOUND 'BAU BAU', OVERRIDE METHOD)
				CHILD CAT (SOUND 'MEOW MEOW', OVERRIDE METHOD)
				
				* DOG IS FORM OF ANIMAL
				* CAT IS FORM OF ANIMAL
				
		Action 	-METHOD OVERRIDE VIRTUAL OR ABSTRACT METHODS AND PROPERTIES /RUNTIME, DYNAMIC POPYMORPHISM, ONE METHOD WITH SAME NAME AND PARAMETERS/
				-METHOD OVERLOADING MANY METHODS WITH SAME NAME BUT DIFF PARAMETERS /COMPILE, STATIC POLYMORPHISM/
				-BY INTERFACES WHICH GIVE  METHODS AND  PROPERTIES OF COMMON OBJECTS. CHILDRENS DEFINES BEHEVAIOR OF METHODS
		Benefits - code reusability
				 -  single variable name for multiple data types.
				 - Reduces coupling between different functionalities.
